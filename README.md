NowNotes is a simple app made as a *usable* replacement for the Windows Notepad.

Windows Notepad is ok to take notes quickly, just type 'Notepad' on the Windows Search and start typing on it. It's simple and only uses a few resources.

But it's as simple as impractical.

NowNotes is a simple app made specially for that, trying to immitate something similar to the 'Quick Notes' function of iPadOS and macOS.

### Simple, but clearer texts.

It's simple to use, just click on the anytime available icon at the system tray and start typing. With NowNotes, notes are more intuitive. It allows you to do simple formating; bold, italic or underlined text are available, as well as titles.

### Your desktop. Panic-less.

Your desktop will never be a disaster again. The notes are saved *automatically* right on NowNotes, and aren't on any common folder, so don't mind. Talking about desktop: when NowNotes is open, it's all time on the top of it, so you don't have to reopen and reopen the app every time it dissapears.

## To-do list

- [x] Cloud sync
- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] Folders

## Installing

Just download the latest .exe on 'Releases', or clone the repository and compile it with Visual Studio .NET.

**NOTE:** If you download the .exe through Releases, is possible to Microsoft Defender flag the file as malware. As I know this is caused by Inno Setup, which causes a false positive. (???) Meanwhile I don't know how to fix that, you can download the code and compile it if you feel more secure. :D
